    "text": "Navigation\nThe following problem is inspired by the first problem in the 2021 Advent of Code challenge and as a result is Santa-themed.\nYou’re minding your own business on a ship at sea when the overboard alarm goes off! You rush to see if you can help. Apparently, one of the Elves tripped and accidentally sent the sleigh keys flying into the ocean! Before you know it, you’re inside a submarine the Elves keep ready for situations like this.\nAs the submarine drops below the surface of the ocean, it automatically performs a sonar sweep of the nearby sea floor. On a small screen, the sonar sweep report (your puzzle input) appears: each line is a measurement of the sea floor depth as the sweep looks further and further away from the submarine.\nFor example, suppose you had the following report:\n199\n200\n208\n210\n200\n207\n240\n269\n260\n263\nThis report indicates that, scanning outward from the submarine, the sonar sweep found depths of 199, 200, 208, 210, and so on.\nThe first order of business is to figure out how quickly the depth increases, just so you know what you’re dealing with - you never know if the keys will get carried into deeper water by an ocean current or a fish or something.\nTo do this, count the number of times a depth measurement increases from the previous measurement. (There is no measurement before the first measurement.) In the example above, the changes are as follows:\n199 (N/A - no previous measurement)\n200 (increased)\n208 (increased)\n210 (increased)\n200 (decreased)\n207 (increased)\n240 (increased)\n269 (increased)\n260 (decreased)\n263 (increased)\nIn this example, there are 7 measurements that are larger than the previous measurement.\nHow many measurements are larger than the previous measurement?\n\nPart 1 - Planning the solution\nDraw a program flow map to show how you plan to solve the problem. I used excalidraw.com to draw the maps in the book.\nExport your map to a png, upload it to an image hosting site like imgur, and include the link here. Make sure to link directly to the PNG (right click, get link to image).\n\n\n\nPart 2 - Writing the code\nYou have two files, hw4data-r.txt and hw4data-py.txt. I have provided you with code to read the data in from these files (if they aren’t in your current working directory, run the chunk in the Set-up section, which creates the files).\n\nR\n\nx <- readLines(\"hw5data-r.txt\")\n\n## Solve the problem below this comment\n\n\nnx <- NA # Your answer should be stored in the nx variable to make the line below this chunk work\n\nThere are NA measurements larger than the previous measurement.\n\n\nPython\n\nimport numpy as np\nx = np.loadtxt('hw5data-py.txt')\n\n## Solve the problem below this comment\n\n\nnx2 = 0 # your answer should be stored in the nx variable to make the line below this chunk work\n\nThere are 0 measurements larger than the previous measurement."

You can use a series of logical statements if you want, but it may be more effective to find a numerical function or functions that will perform the operation you want.\nfloor() and math.floor() in R and python respectively are good places to start.\nCreate a scatterplot (use geom_point) of your happy year vs decade to show that your approach succeeded.\n\n\nCreate a new data set by iterating through each year to find the proportion of people who are very happy. Use a for loop. Using your new data frame, plot the proportion of very happy people over time.\nNote: You may have to pass an argument to the mean function to tell it to exclude missing values from the calculation, such as na.rm or skipna. Or, you can remove the NAs from happy using a function like na.omit or dropna, but be careful to only drop rows with an NA in variables we care about, like happy or year.\n\nThe code below provides an example of how to create a summary dataset and handle NAs in R and python.
