    "text": "What is the difference between a script and a notebook?\nReplace this paragraph with 2-3 sentences describing your understanding of the difference between a script and a notebook. Your answer should be applicable to R or python (so if you discuss python notebooks, you should also discuss the equivalent in R). Use markdown formatting as described in this cheat-sheet. You may want to provide a table or itemized list, and you should use code formatting to indicate file extensions and programming languages."
